## Graphs in higher dimensions

[Graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph) are fundamental in computer science. Everywhere you go, you hear people talking about networks, connections and other graph like euphemisms.  Graphs are used to model all sorts of things:

* [Social networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network)
* [Distributed systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)
* [Ecological networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_network)
* [The human brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network)

But graphs are 1 dimensional structures (even though they can be embedded in higher dimensional spaces), and in geometry they are often insufficient to describe the sorts of objects which we are interested in, like surfaces and solids. However, topology in 1-dimension can be deceptively simple, and in carrying out the generalization of graphs to higher dimensional spaces there are multiple possibilities.

### CW complexes

There are multiple ways to generalize graphs, though the most successful has been the concept of a [cell complex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_cell_complex). Cell complexes are made out of simple units called *cells*, which are then glued together to form a larger and more complex space. Types of cell complexes differ in the sorts of cells that they allow and the ways in which they are glued together. For example, [Closure-Weak (CW) complexes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex) are a popular mathematical formulation for spaces in [homotopy theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy). In a CW complex, cells can be any [contractible space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractible_space) (picture: a blob/potato), and the binding relations are arbitrary [homeomorphisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism) (picture: stretch/squish the blobs and glue them together). This generality is mathematically convenient for constructing and reasoning about spaces on paper, but it can be hard to translate into a computer.

### Simplicial complexes

Instead, more restricted types of cell complexes are often more useful when it comes down to crunching numbers. The most popular digital representation of spaces are [simplicial complexes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex). Simplicial complexes are widely used in graphics and engineering, and they are the representation that we will be focusing.  The basic idea in a simplicial complex is to build up a space by gluing together [simplices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex). Briefly,

* A 0D simplex is a point
* A 1D simplex is an edge
* A 2D simplex is a [triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle)
* A 3D simplex is a [tetrahedron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron)
* ...

The connection between graphs and simplicial complexes should be clear, since a graph is a 1D simplicial complex is exactly a graph.

### Other types of cell complexes

Finally, it is worth briefly mentioning a few of the other options for encoding cells (though we won't say much about them in detail):

* [Cubical complexes](http://inperc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Cubical_complex): Cubical complexes represent geometry as a union of boxes or hypercubes (think Minecraft).  For certain types of boxy geometry, they can be much more eficient than simplices, but are more limited in the sorts of shapes they can represent.
* [Whitney regular stratification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratification_%28mathematics%29): Stratifications represent spaces as a decomposition of semi-algebraic sets, allowing for smooth shapes like polynomial curves, surfaces and so on.
* [Hypergraphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph): Hypergraphs are similar to simplicial sets, but adopt different notation.

## Basic concepts in simplicial complexes

### Definition

As discussed previously, simplicial complexes are closely related to undirected graphs. Like a graph, a simplicial complex, (V,C), is made up of two pieces of data:

* A set of vertices, V, representing points in some space
* A set of cells, C, made up of finite subsets of V

We also require that all subsets of all cells in C are also contained in C. Note that the cells here are *sets*, not tuples, so order does not matter. This means that in any cell the vertices of the cell are not repeated (so no self loops). Because C is a set, we don't allow for repeated cells either (so no repeated edges).

### Skeletons

For each cell, we say that the *dimension* of the cell is equal to the (number of elements in the cell) - 1. For example, a cell with one element is 0 dimensional, a cell with 2 elements is 1 dimensional, and so on. Under this identification, we can group all of the cells in the complex by dimension. This leads us to the concept of the [n-skeleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-skeleton) of a simplicial complex, which is the collection of all n-dimensional cells in the complex.

### Faces and incidence

The faces of an n-cell are the set of all (n-1)-subsets of the cell.  A cell S is incident to a cell T if it is a proper subset of that cell.

### Triangulations

A triangulation of a space is a homeomorphsism from a simplicial complex to that space.  Not all space can be triangulated though.  For example, the [E8 manifold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_manifold) is a 4D space that cannot be triangulated (that is there is no simplicial complex which can represent this space, even up to topology).

## Variations on simplicial complexes

In graph theory, one encounters many different types of graphs:

* [Undirected graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)#Undirected_graph)
* [Directed graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)#Directed_graph)
* [Multigraphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)#Multigraph)
* [Graphs with loops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_%28graph_theory%29)
* [Weighted graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)#Weighted_graph)

As we've already seen, simplicial complexes generalize undirected graphs, and like undirected graphs simplicial complexes can be generalized along these same lines.
